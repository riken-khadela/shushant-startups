      "description": "PicnicHealth is all about making medical records easy to access and using data to power the next frontier of medical research. We’re led by the belief that there’s power in medical information when it’s used well, and that every person has a right to their own theirs. And we've built award-winning machine learning to do it.How? PicnicHealthworks directly with patients to give them the only tool anywhere that truly provides all of their medical records from any doctor or healthcare system in the US—in an easy-to-use, secure online dashboard. Not only that, but patients can choose to contribute their data to scientific research, which helps life sciences researchers accelerate breakthroughs in care. Researchers use this anonymized “real-world data” to understand how diseases are experienced by patients and treated by clinicians in the real world, going beyond the highly controlled setting of clinical trials. The goal is to create better treatments that can ultimately improve outcomes for patients.Whether you’re a scientist, engineer, or patient yourself, we’re looking for passionate people to join us in redefining an industry during our next stage of growth. To date we’ve helped tens of thousands of patients, partnered with some of the world’s largest biopharma companies, and raised more than $35M from Felicis Ventures, Amplify Partners, Foresite Capital, Refactor Capital, and Y Combinator.Read More",
